# ******************************************************
# *   Important information about XMLVM jar location   *
# ******************************************************
#
# It is required to define the location of the xmlvm.jar file.
# The xmlvm template generator will provide a valid location, but in
# the case this binary changes place, the location should be defined
# in file "nbproject/project.properties", property "xmlvm.sdk.jar",
# or else compilation will break.


# Xcode project type. Valid values are:
# iphone           iPhone project skeleton
# ipad             iPad project skeleton
# ios              iPhone and iPad project skeleton
# iphone3          Legacy iPhone 3.1 project skeleton
xmlvm.project=iphone

# Select which will be the default target. This is a case sensitive parameter.
# Valid options are:
#   Xcode   : to execute as an Xcode project
#   Java    : to execute with the Java simulator
#   Android : to execute as an Android application
default.target=Xcode

# Add extra libraries required for the project.
# In order to create an android project, then the android
# library should be present like this:
# xmlvm.lib=android
xmlvm.lib=android

# Add extra resources required for the project
# This is a colon separated list of files that will be used verbatim in Xcode
# project.
# If a directory is provided, then if the name ends with "/", the contents
# of this directory will be used. If not, a verbatim copy of the directory will
# be used.
# This can also be used to add extra source files to the project. Only one
# level deep will be searched for source files (thus either a file should be
# given or a directory ending with "/").

# Use custom fonts for your application. This feature is supported for
# iOS version 3.2 onwards. You need to provide the TTF font file name.

# Set the supported orientations for this application.
# This is a colon ( : ) separated list of possible values.
# Valid options are the same as with the interfaceorientation parameter.
# For example, to support only portrait modes, this is how it can be done.
# orientations.supported=UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait:UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown
